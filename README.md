# Compiler

## How to use

- Requirements: flex and bison must've been installed

```bash
sudo apt install bison flex
```

- Running lex and sintax:

```bash
make run
```

- To run the compiler:

```bash
./compiler input.txt
```

# TODO
- semantic analysis (maybe)
- create markdown file teaching how to use the compiler
